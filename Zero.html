I wanted to follow up the meeting yesterday ( JFAC ) with some examples for you to review regarding the first item, diversion or as it is listed Intercept 0.

A person "filtered"  (see image below)  from entering into the next stage, law enforcement, is saved from the unhelpful "punishments" which the current system seeks to impose. Many people in the criminal justice system are starting to realize that containment, isolation, and monetary punishment are not effective when it comes to mental illnesses.

Many other communities are attempting to implement this Model, <a href="https://chicagomentalhealth.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/cook-county-il-sim-report-final.pdf"> Cook County Detailed implemntation plan </a> and have, I think, valuable lessons in the "GAP" analysis which is something which the  Ken Ray and Eva Hill reports discuss in detail.

<p>
How can this fiscal body move to assist CenterStones endeavors (with Stride and Mobile Crisis ) so that Centerstone doesn't prevent other community organizations from being able to fill the gaps in the Intercept planning?
