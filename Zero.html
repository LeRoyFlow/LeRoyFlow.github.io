I wanted to follow up the meeting yesterday ( JFAC ) with some examples for you to review regarding the first item, diversion or as it is listed Intercept 0. 
</p> 
<p>
A person "filtered"  (see image below)  from entering into the next stage, law enforcement, is saved from the unhelpful "punishments" which the current system seeks to impose. Many people in the criminal justice system are starting to realize that containment, isolation, and monetary punishment are not effective when it comes to mental illnesses.

Many other communities are attempting to implement this Model, <a href="https://chicagomentalhealth.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/cook-county-il-sim-report-final.pdf"> Cook County Detailed implemntation plan </a> and have, I think, valuable lessons in the "GAP" analysis which is something which the report presented by <a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1664979738_1777.pdf"> Eve Hill report discusses in detail on page 59.</a>

How can this fiscal body move to assist in these endeavors when Centerstone is unable to provide services? </b>It seems that many cases exist in which CenterStone is positioned to prevent rather than facilitate other community organizations from filling the gaps that exist in this Intercept zero planning.

<li><b>
How can we track the benefits from CenterStone or other health provider services, be it Moblie Crisis, Cool Down Centers like Stride and Detox? </b> As I listen to the Director of Stride present to the Council it was all starbursts and glitter but the data which proves that the services are "working" have not been developed and provided. I am not an expert on this but I believe both Indiana Center for Recovery and New Leaf New Life are seen not as collaborators but competitors to CenterStone. The presentation by Sherrif Skinner made one thing very clear - all of the health providers need to play together. <a href="https://sites.bsu.edu/addictionscoalition/"> Addictions Coalition of Delaware County </a>
