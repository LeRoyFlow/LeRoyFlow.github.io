<li> <p> <a href=https://bailproject.org/model/">The Bail Project</a> is a NonProfit group which provides bail to people in jail without the ability to pay. This group has been <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2022/05/04/bail-project-sues-indiana-over-law-restricting-who-they-bail-out-of-jail/9632177002/"> targeted </a> by <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2022/bills/house/1300"> legislators </a> and have sucessfully made it impossible for this organization to help people who have been arrested and detained, pretrail, in Indiana jails. 

The complex risk assessment which is carried out by the Court is not considered when people are given a bail amount which they can not pay. This is one of the ways which we keep people without funds incarcerated.

<b> The collected data by the courts show that more people, who commit violent crimes while out on bond, have been let out by paying money to the "for profit" bond agencies.</b> So why did Indiana legislators feel the need to "outlaw" The Bail Project from providing bond people in Indiana jails.  
</b>
<p> This appeals argument by "The Bail Project" is interesting as we think about re-entry and people getting to leave the jail. <a href="https://leroyflow.github.io/assets/Bail-Law-Challenge.pdf"><b> Bail-Law-Challenge.</b> </a>

This decision is further complicated by <a href="https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2023/resolutions/senate/joint/1"> SJR1 </a>updating the thinking about  "who qualifies for release and bail"  langauge after a long histroy of litigation on the subject.
The Bail Project has published <a href="https://bailproject.org/press/the-bail-project-opposes-indiana-senate-joint-resolution-1-sjr-1/"> this article </a> discussing the history. 
<p>
Also in the mix is Indiana Criminal Trial Rule 26 which is described neatly here in the <a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1685472840_44937.pdf">2022 MC Probation Annual report.</a>
<p>
<ul><li>Indiana Criminal Rule 26 was the foundation for the 11 Indiana counties participating in the Pretrial
Pilot Project. Criminal Rule 26 was codified in Indiana law (IC 35-31.5-2-121.5 et. seq.) and became
effective for all Indiana courts January 1, 2020. Criminal Rule (CR) 26 is intended to improve pretrial
practices in Indiana by encouraging trial judges to engage in evidence-based decision making at the
pretrial stage. The Rule encourages trial courts to use risk assessment results and other relevant
information about arrestees to determine if the individual presents a substantial risk of flight or danger to
self or others in the community; thereby, informing release decisions and release conditions. With the
statewide implementation of Criminal Rule 26 on January 1, 2020, Monroe County changed the name of
the program to reflect that it is no longer a “pilot program.” The program is now entitled the “Monroe
County Pretrial Services Program.” Monroe County’s Pretrial Services Program is integrated into the
Community Corrections division of the Probation Department.
<b>
The mission of the Pretrial Services Program is to assist the court in making pretrial release decisions
that are prompt and equitable for all defendants regardless of ability to pay bail and provide information
to the court that will maximize the court’s ability to determine effective release conditions that promote
community safety.

The DOJ/C in Indiana has created and deployed to all counties the mandatory individual "Assessment" for "criminal" needs,  which is a standardized online form,  entered by the probation office, to determine who gets and how much it will cost to bail them out. 
It is suppose to standardize something about setting bail across judicial districts and prevent both overly harsh and overly lientient actions by judges.

<p>
The Indiana Risk Assessment System is described as a “series of tools used to access criminal offenders under supervision. (e.g. on probation, in drug treatment, etc. ) and determine their risk of reoffending.” ( IDOC web page.) 
</p>
<p>
The system was put into place by the Indiana Office of the Court Services ( IOCS) on behalf of the Judicial Conference of Indiana and adapted from University of Cincinnati, Center for Criminal Justice research in Ohio Risk Assessment System and Ohio Youth Assessment System.  http://www.ocjs.ohio.gov/ORAS_FinalReport.pdf 
</p>

<p>The original (2006) motivation was to improve consistency and facilitate communication across criminal justice agencies. It was crafted by  Dr. Paula H. Smith  and the late Dr. Ed Latessa. The goal was to develop a Risk Assessment which would predict recidivism at multiple points while a person is under “supervision”. These points are 
<br>
Pretrial 
<br>
Community Supervision 
<br>
Institution intake 
<br>
community reentry. 
<br>
<p> “The major goal of the assessment system was to conform to the principles of effective classification” and further to allocate resources to reduce recidivism. Managing risk vs reducing risk as the marker of a success. 
The system relies heavily upon the work of Andrew Bonta and Hoge ( 1990 ) “ Classification for effective rehabilitation: Rediscovering psychology." </p>
There is already <a href="https://www.pretrial.org/why-pretrial-matters"> evidence </a> that there are problems with these type of measurement tools.
